# path_planner

I developed this library as an alternative for simple path planning using an map image. We are using this application in an Assistive Indoor Navigation app at the City College Robotics Lab. 

# How to use it 

## Initilize a PathPlanner object using a 2D byte array that represents the occupancy image

PathPlanner pathPlanner = new PathPlanner(); 

## Create a path 

### First, we need to set the origin. 

### Second, we need to set the destination. 

### Get list of waypoints

### Remove visited waypoints
